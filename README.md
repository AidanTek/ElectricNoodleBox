Open Source Hardware from/with Electric Noodle Box

I'm currently developing this repository, it is a little slim on documentation right now. This page is a good place to start - [Modular Series Overview](https://electricnoodlebox.com/tutorials/modular-series-overview/). Priorities for next updates are to include BOM for each project. I am working on guides for each design on my site. 

The Electric Noodle Box Modular Series circuits are [open source hardware](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/) designs released under the [CERN-OSH-W](https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_w_v2.txt) license. The aim is to help you learn how to build electronic instruments, and to make building more accessible. I chose to release designs this way in recognition of my own learning, made possible by the rich history of DIY sound electronics available in the public domain. Open source hardware allows for continued dialogue in making and inventing and I want you to be able to take part in the conversation, whatever point you are at in your learning journey.

All hardware files are produced in Eagle. The free version of Eagle will allow you to browse, modify and create GERBERs for production - many PCB fabs will take Eagle files directly. I have also provided the ENB Eagle library to maintain parts that might not be included in the standard libraries. Please let me know by raising an issue if you have any problems accessing or opening these files.

## License

The CERN-OSH-W allows you to use all source files in this repository in any way you wish. It requires that any resources you use from here remain as open source, even if used in a wider project that is otherwise closed. 

I chose this license so you are not restricted in your use of the source contentno matter what your plans are. I am interested in what you do with these designs however as I want them to stimulate learning and dialogue. My personal request is that you consider sharing ideas if choose to make, modify or integrate content from this source.
