Open Source Hardware from/with Electric Noodle Box

I'm currently developing this repository, it is a little slim on documentation right now. This page is a good place to start - [Modular Series Overview](https://electricnoodlebox.com/tutorials/modular-series-overview/) 

The Electric Noodle Box Modular Series circuits are [open source hardware](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/) designs released under the [CERN-OSH-W](https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_w_v2.txt) license. The aim is to help you learn how to build electronic instruments, and to make building more accessible. I chose to release designs this way in recognition of my own learning, made possible by the rich history of DIY sound electronics available in the public domain. Open source hardware allows for continued dialogue in making and inventing and I want you to be able to take part in the conversation, whatever point you are at in your learning journey.
